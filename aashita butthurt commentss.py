Text   This is a sacred lake,u cant step on a frozen lake just for taking photographs and get a few likes and comments. These all high altitude lakes are pilgrimages. Have some respect for local sentiments.

Text   @rijulshergill With due regards sir, I’ll like you to review about the ways in which this post might not fit into your “Portraits of wrong” and for also accusing the people who liked this post with a total sense of genuine generosity. This is what you should notice:  1. The surface water of the lake freezes at 32 F. The freezing then spreads downwards into the lake and the ice thickens. So the lake was all densely frozen.  2. Taking the reference of the picture in the post, it’s likely visible with the layers of apparels I’m wearing along with the shoes I’ve put on. There’s no point of hypothetical situations happening anyhow. 3. With this concern of yours, I’ll like to tell you that I’m safe with all my senses and knowledge about what’s wrong and right while on a trek. 4. With people all around the country polluting the sacred rivers of Ganga and Yamuna by bathing, washing clothes, putting garbage and doing toiletries. I don’t believe that me standing on the “frozen lake” could harm the river in any possible way. 5. I’m aware of the fact about how fragile our environment and economy is, and with this due concern, I’ve picked almost every plastic bags and garbage I could find on my way to the top, at this altitude of 9626 ft with a mission to keep my earth green and clean. Also, with the clauses you mentioned, there was absolutely no destruction or damages done. It was with all my genuine respect that I visited this holy place and only cleaned and helped to keep it green - which is the least I could have done. I respect your comment and your concern, but it was highly not acceptable of you accusing the fellow members of the travel community or the locals who showed support for this post. We’re all young people with the perfect sense of how our environment and ecology should be kept safe, without disrupting the norms.

Text   @aayush_kullu Respected sir, I’ll like to mention that there are rivers and lakes in our country (of most concern- Ganga and Yamuna) which are being polluted in ways I could not even imagine. There’s so much that can be done about it, and me going to this Holy lake with a mission of making the surrounding clean and green won’t hurt the sentiments of people. There’s already so much going around in this world, and having said that, I believe me making few steps for the clean and green environment could add to the generosity this world is lacking.

Text   @aashita_jhamb वो सब ठीक है and well done if u did that पर being a local from Himachal and connected to the adventure field and local Dev Sanskriti i have to tell u that stepping on these lake is not allowed. We have been coming across various pics on social media in which people are not following certain rules which have to be followed at these places. Rest all is ok :)

Text   @the_name_is_akshat_ romeo bhai jo jaise bhasha samjhta hai hum usse uske bhasha mein he samjhate hain phir . Bataya tha pyar se that Himalayas mein certain rules and regulations hote . There is a thing called respect for local beliefs but aap jaise fukre kaha samjhte yeh baat . Pyar se batao toh ulta humpe haavi hone lagte phir hume bhi kadak bhasha mein karne padti baat . You are very young , learn to respect others beliefs also. And yes unlike you i dont have an inflated ego i know where i have gone wrong in this conversation and i will certainly ponder upon it and work on improving myself.

Text   @rijulshergill look you are not getting it right . We r going nowhere. I just want ki you go after people who visits there nd harm the environment who puts garbage dere nd create a mess. But if someone is going for exploring places clicking pictures is no harm to the mountains or the river. So I just request u to take off all ur cmnts made nd concern about those who are really damaging the place . That too with dignity and making them realise their mistake what harm in clicking pictures there nothing . So just think again for a moment
@rijulshergill
User  rijulshergill
Text   @the_name_is_akshat_ there is no harm in clicking pictures . I never objected to that . This lake is sacred to us. We never step on it with our shoes on . Walking on this lake when its frozen is like stepping on Lord Shiva directly as this lake is dedicated him. Moreover some foolish tour guys have started selling trips to this lake in winter months which is really bad. These holy places are off limits in the months of December Jan Feb March April. Scientifically if we see if we go there during these months it harms the Ecology and environment. You are not getting this point. So what hurt us what when she wrote and posted " Stepped on the frozen lake " .
@the_name_is_akshat_
User  rijulshergill
Text   @the_name_is_akshat_ and if you see so many people visit this place and who are we to object as they are open for all and one is free to enjoy the beauty of nature . What is disrespectful and annoying is disrespecting the faith associated with that area . Today polluting environment not only means littering a place with filth but also disregarding the local belief of that area. You millennials disregard beliefs outrightly. Not all of you but most you .
@the_name_is_akshat_
User  the_name_is_akshat_
Text   @rijulshergill again you are blaming the wrong person for this . if it's religious to you then ask authorities and government to officially declare ban on walking over it ..Fight with the tour operators . Why blame tourists when don't know about that. Put many signs on the way to tell people about ur concern. Every lake is a lake for people sapne me to nhi aayega na ki religious beliefs are associated with it. So back off and go against the right people for ur movement
@rijulshergill
User  rijulshergill
Text   @the_name_is_akshat_ so now you know about it . Right ? Will you show respect ? Or will you still wait until an official board is put up there ? Its not only religious to me but to the entire 70 lakh population of Himachal. Remember one thing " Respecting one's belief only shows our tolerance "

I don’t believe that me standing on the “frozen lake” could harm the river in any possible way. 5. I’m aware of the fact about how fragile our environment and economy is, and with this due concern, I’ve picked almost every plastic bags and garbage I could find on my way to the top, at this altitude of 9626 ft with a mission to keep my earth green and clean. Also, with the clauses you mentioned, there was absolutely no destruction or damages done. It was with all my genuine respect that I visited this holy place and only cleaned and helped to keep it green - which is the least I could have done. I respect your comment and your concern, but it was highly not acceptable of you accusing the fellow members of the travel community or the locals who showed support for this post. We’re all young people with the perfect sense of how our environment and ecology should be kept safe, without disrupting the norms.
aashita_jhamb  :   @aayush_kullu Respected sir, I’ll like to mention that there are rivers and lakes in our country (of most concern- Ganga and Yamuna) which are being polluted in ways I could not even imagine. There’s so much that can be done about it, and me going to this Holy lake with a mission of making the surrounding clean and green won’t hurt the sentiments of people. There’s already so much going around in this world, and having said that, I believe me making few steps for the clean and green environment could add to the generosity this world is lacking.
aayush_kullu  :   @aashita_jhamb वो सब ठीक है and well done if u did that पर being a local from Himachal and connected to the adventure field and local Dev Sanskriti i have to tell u that stepping on these lake is not allowed. We have been coming across various pics on social media in which people are not following certain rules which have to be followed at these places. Rest all is ok :)
saurabhmadeel  :   @aashita_jhamb पहाड़ों में आओ घूमो एन्जॉय करो मगर लोकल लोगो कि मान्यता और भावनाओं को बिना ठेस पहुंचा कर। पहाड़ों में झीले पहाड़ी लोगो की आस्था और भक्ति से जुड़ी होती है। इन झीलों में तो लोकल पहाड़ी लोग खुद नहीं घुसते ताकि इसकी पवित्रता पर कोई आंच न आए। इन स्थानों को पूजा और आस्था का प्रतीक मानते हैं मगर शहर और भारत के दूसरे जगह से आकर लोग कोई इन झीलों पर डांस इंडिया का शो कर रहा तो कोई इंस्टग्राम के लिए फोटो सेशन। भाई लोग पहाड़ में घूमना है तो घूमो, कोई नहीं रोकता मगर वहां के नियम कानून और आस्था को चोट ना पहुंचाओ।
vashistbhavyam  :   लोगों को टॉयलेट में गंदगी करनी चाहिए, ऐसा वे इंस्टाग्राम पर क्यों करते हैं|

aayush_kullu  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ भाई साहब हम इधर हमारा तुम्हारा नही कर रहे,we are just telling you to follow the rules,अगर कर सकते हो तो everybody is most welcome
aayush_kullu  :   If you can follow the rules you are most welcome and if not you don't deserve to be at these sacred places. That's all
aayush_kullu  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ the problem with u people is your ego and attitude which doesn't permit you to listen what is being told even by the natives of that place u are talking about. We have informed the committee and strict measures will be taken now by them to avoid any such nuisance.
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ romeo bhai jo jaise bhasha samjhta hai hum usse uske bhasha mein he samjhate hain phir . Bataya tha pyar se that Himalayas mein certain rules and regulations hote . There is a thing called respect for local beliefs but aap jaise fukre kaha samjhte yeh baat . Pyar se batao toh ulta humpe haavi hone lagte phir hume bhi kadak bhasha mein karne padti baat . You are very young , learn to respect others beliefs also. And yes unlike you i dont have an inflated ego i know where i have gone wrong in this conversation and i will certainly ponder upon it and work on improving myself.
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ ek last baat yaad rakhna if you will respect the mountains they will respect you but if you disregard them you shall perish .
the_name_is_akshat_  :   @rijulshergill look you are not getting it right . We r going nowhere. I just want ki you go after people who visits there nd harm the environment who puts garbage dere nd create a mess. But if someone is going for exploring places clicking pictures is no harm to the mountains or the river. So I just request u to take off all ur cmnts made nd concern about those who are really damaging the place . That too with dignity and making them realise their mistake what harm in clicking pictures there nothing . So just think again for a moment
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ there is no harm in clicking pictures . I never objected to that . This lake is sacred to us. We never step on it with our shoes on . Walking on this lake when its frozen is like stepping on Lord Shiva directly as this lake is dedicated him. Moreover some foolish tour guys have started selling trips to this lake in winter months which is really bad. These holy places are off limits in the months of December Jan Feb March April. Scientifically if we see if we go there during these months it harms the Ecology and environment. You are not getting this point. So what hurt us what when she wrote and posted " Stepped on the frozen lake " .
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ and if you see so many people visit this place and who are we to object as they are open for all and one is free to enjoy the beauty of nature . What is disrespectful and annoying is disrespecting the faith associated with that area . Today polluting environment not only means littering a place with filth but also disregarding the local belief of that area. You millennials disregard beliefs outrightly. Not all of you but most you .
the_name_is_akshat_  :   @rijulshergill again you are blaming the wrong person for this . if it's religious to you then ask authorities and government to officially declare ban on walking over it ..Fight with the tour operators . Why blame tourists when don't know about that. Put many signs on the way to tell people about ur concern. Every lake is a lake for people sapne me to nhi aayega na ki religious beliefs are associated with it. So back off and go against the right people for ur movement
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ so now you know about it . Right ? Will you show respect ? Or will you still wait until an official board is put up there ? Its not only religious to me but to the entire 70 lakh population of Himachal. Remember one thing " Respecting one's belief only shows our tolerance "
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ if you go through the thread you will see we had already explained this thing but when this " we dont give a damn " attitude came in its then that we had to write a few harsh things . Anyways be a responsible tourist . Carpe Diem
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ **** offf ! Typical ***hole delhite . And i will personally see to it that you are kicked off from Himachal border if i come to know of your visit.
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ i dont need to advertise myself romeo. Kar li na ladki impress mil gaye khushi ab ? So ja ab
rijulshergill  :   @the_name_is_akshat_ ab boluga ne tujhe time aane pe lag jayega pata. Tum bhikari log karte ho marketing kyonki tumhare zindagi chalti hai uspe. Chal beta ab last time likh raha bus ab teri yeh akkar aur hekdi likhke ne asli mein utarke dikhauga .
pankaj1301  :   @rijulshergill deleted my cmnts thinking u got some brains but after this last cmnt of urs � u blocked me. But just let me remind u again these cheap publicity stunts will take u no where. Personal cmnts and weak allegations u r urself exposed. This is a source of living for u by marketing nd politicising gaining cheap publicity.. people are seeing it ab jo likhna ho likho but u r totally exposed Mr. Attention Seaker
rijulshergill  :   Ouch someone is butthurt. You jumped into the comments section thinking by doing so you will be able to impress her . You got your two minutes fame right ? Happy . I keep beggers like you as worker at my place . And we know how fattu you outsiders are very good at speaking but when you get spanking you cry like hell. We deal with creeps like you on daily basis here . Now make another profile and comment ha ha .
aayush_kullu  :   @rijulshergill अच्छे अतिथि सत्कार के लायक है ये वैसे
aashita_jhamb  :   @harshitakaul71 Imissyou❤️
